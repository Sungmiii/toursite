Practice an advanced CSS and Sass
without JS :smile:

This Sass project is following one of the Udemy Sass course.

I have learned more about the tranform, transition and animation.
I used them often for my personal portfolio homepage but I didn't understand how it actually worked.
Through this project, I am not confident to use the Clip-path,tranform and animation also media query with the efficient way.
